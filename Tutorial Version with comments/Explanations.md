# Let's break down the context of recursion and backtracking using this project as reference

This document explains the concepts of recursion and backtracking using this Sudoku solver project as a practical reference. These terms can feel abstract â€” but when applied step-by-step, they become intuitive.

Weâ€™ll explore:
- What recursion is and how it works
- What backtracking means and why itâ€™s powerful
- How these two combine to solve Sudoku
- A full walkthrough of how the script flows, using actual code line references from solver_tutorial.py and main_tutorial.py

## Recursion

**Recursion** is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. In the context of this Sudoku solver, recursion is used to try filling the board one cell at a time, calling the same function (`solve_gui`) to attempt to solve the rest of the board after each placement.

Think of it like this:
"To solve this puzzle, Iâ€™ll try something, and if it doesnâ€™t work, Iâ€™ll go back and try a different option â€” using the same method again and again."

**In the code:**  
- See `solve_gui` in `solver_tutorial.py` (lines 34â€“70).
- After placing a number in an empty cell, the function calls itself:  
  ```python
  if solve_gui(board, screen, draw_func):
      return True
This means: "If placing this number leads to a solution for the rest of the board, we're done!"

**Why use recursion here?**
Recursion allows us to break down the big problem ("solve the whole board") into smaller problems ("solve the rest of the board after this move"), until we reach a base case (no empty cells left).


## Backtracking
**Backtracking** is a strategy for finding solutions by trying out possible options and undoing ("backtracking") them if they lead to a dead end. In Sudoku, if a number placement leads to a contradiction later, we remove it and try the next possible number.

**In the code:**  
- Still in `solve_gui` in `solver_tutorial.py` (see line 66).
  ```python
  board[row][col] = 0
If none of the numbers 1â€“9 work for a cell, the function returns False (line 60), which triggers backtracking in the previous recursive call.

**Why use backtracking here?**
Sudoku is a constraint satisfaction problem. Backtracking lets us systematically explore all possible number placements, undoing choices that don't work, until we find a valid solution or exhaust all options.


## How Recursion and Backtracking Work Together in This Project
1. Find an empty cell (find_empty, lines 18â€“25 in solver_tutorial.py).
2. Try numbers 1â€“9 in that cell.
3. For each number:
    - Check if it's valid (is_valid, lines 5â€“17).
    - If valid, place the number and recursively try to solve the rest of the board.
    - If the recursive call returns False, remove the number (backtrack) and try the next one.
4. If all numbers fail, return False to backtrack further.
This combination is a classic and efficient way to solve puzzles like Sudoku.


## Why This Approach?
- Recursion simplifies the logic: each call is responsible for solving a smaller part of the puzzle.
- Backtracking ensures we don't get stuck: if a choice leads to a dead end, we undo it and try something else.
- This combination is a classic and efficient way to solve puzzles like Sudoku.


## Script Flow Walkthrough
Let's clarify how the main components interact:

1. Program starts (main_tutorial.py, main() function):
Initializes the GUI and loads the example board.
Sets up the main event loop.

2. User Interaction:
User can select cells, input numbers, and click buttons ("Solve", "Customize", "Reset").
All changes are made to temp_board, which represents the current state of the board.

3. Solving the Puzzle:
When "Solve" is clicked, solve_gui is called with a copy of the current board.
solve_gui uses recursion and backtracking to fill the board, updating the GUI at each step for visualization.

4. Key Functions:
- is_valid(board, num, pos): Checks if a number can be placed at a given position.
- find_empty(board): Finds the next empty cell.
- solve_gui(board, screen, draw_func): The recursive backtracking solver with GUI updates.
- draw_func(screen, board, pos, num, action): Handles the animation of placing/removing numbers during solving.

5. Event Loop:
Handles user input (mouse and keyboard).
Redraws the grid and numbers after every interaction.

6. Board State:
- original_board: The starting puzzle (unchanged).
- temp_board: The current board (user edits and solving).
After solving, temp_board is updated with the solution.


## Example: Step-by-Step
**Suppose you click "Solve"**
1. The program copies your current board and calls solve_gui.
2. solve_gui finds the first empty cell.
3. It tries numbers 1â€“9 in that cell, checking validity.
4. For each valid number, it places it and recursively tries to solve the rest.
5. If a dead end is reached, it removes the number (backtracks) and tries the next.
6. This continues until the board is solved or all options are exhausted.
Youâ€™ll see this happening live in the GUI: each number placement and removal is drawn in real time.


## Final Thoughts for Beginners

I created this walkthrough because recursion was difficult for me at first â€” I often felt lost in the logic.
So I broke it into:
ðŸ”¹ Find a base case (is the puzzle solved?)
ðŸ”¹ Try every possible number
ðŸ”¹ Validate it
ðŸ”¹ Recurse to the next cell
ðŸ”¹ If it fails, go back

Thatâ€™s it. It may look complex in code, but itâ€™s just smart trial-and-error â€” with memory.

Hope this helped you see recursion + backtracking in action!
